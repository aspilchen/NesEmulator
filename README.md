# NESEmulator
NES Emulator in Rust. This is a work in progress. This doesn't work at the moment. A previous commit would boot a test ROM that played Snake. However, now that proper cartridge mapping and PPU are being implemented, Snake doesnt work anymore.

## TODO:
- Complete CPU instructions (validation, etc.)
- Graphics
- Audio
- System clock and timing
