# NESEmulator
NES Emulator in Rust. This is a work in progress. At the moment the emulator is fixed to running a test cartridge containing Snake, intended to verify the function of CPU instructions (some bugs need fixing)

## TODO:
- Complete CPU instructions (validation, etc.)
- Graphics
- Audio
- System clock and timing
